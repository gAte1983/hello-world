A repository for each idea coming to my mind

My name is Gaetan. I'm a french guy 35 year old.
I'm here today because I decided to take a turn in my professional life.
When I was young, I was able to spend all nights coding in Basic and Visual Basic several years later. I loved coding stuff...
But I choosen another way in college. 
But now, in 2018, it's time to go back with programming !!!
I'm very interested in Swift language and iOS development, so !!! Let's go !

by the way, call me gAte !
